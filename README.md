# ap-tm-cloud-bot

Python based cross server discord bot (which ran in Heroku) I made for three clans to intercommunicate with each other with more ease. However, this group no longer exists so the code kind of
has no use anymore hence why I decided to make this repo public.

I made this in a hurry so please forgive the repetition. It's honestly not my proudest code.

finmain.py is main.
